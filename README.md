# Poly's Jak Movement Analaysis Project

## The Goal

I want to use OpenGOAL to visually track Jak's movement timings (line drawings - visuals) as well as mathematically calculate the distance Jak moved in order to determine distance variations between movement, combinations of movement, and more. 

I have dyscalculia, so being able to have something drawn in addition to the math would be incredibly helpful. I think this game be done with OpenGOAL. I will see what I can do on my own and try to pull from others work as well. I will share all other content I am looking at as I work on this here and update it accordingly.
